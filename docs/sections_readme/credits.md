- VueGen relies on the work of numerous open-source projects like [Streamlit](streamlit), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and others. A big thank you to their authors for making this possible!
- The vuegen logo was designed based on an image created by [Scriberia](https://www.scriberia.co.uk/) for The [Turing Way Community](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way), which is shared under a CC-BY licence.
