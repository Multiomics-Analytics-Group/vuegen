## About the project

VueGen automates the creation of reports based on a directory with plots, dataframes, and other files in different formats. A YAML configuration file is generated from the directory to define the structure of the report. Users can customize the report by modifying the configuration file, or they can create their own configuration file instead of passing a directory as input.

The configuration file specifies the structure of the report, including sections, subsections, and various components such as plots, dataframes, markdown, html, and API calls. Reports can be generated in various formats, including documents (PDF, HTML, DOCX, ODT), presentations (PPTX, Reveal.js), notebooks (Jupyter) or [Streamlit](streamlit) web applications.

An overview of the VueGen workflow is shown in the figure below:

![VueGen Abstract](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multiomics-Analytics-Group/vuegen/main/docs/images/vuegen_graph_abstract.png)

Also, the class diagram for the project is presented below to illustrate the architecture and relationships between classes:

![VueGen Class Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multiomics-Analytics-Group/vuegen/main/docs/images/vuegen_classdiagram_noattmeth.png)

An extended version of the class diagram with attributes and methods is available [here][vuegen-class-diag-att].

The VueGen documentation is available at [vuegen.readthedocs.io][vuegen-docs], where you can find detailed information of the package’s classes and functions, installation and execution instructions, and case studies to demonstrate its functionality.

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to install VueGen inside a virtual environment to manage depenendencies and avoid conflicts with existing packages. You can use the virtual environment manager of your choice, such as `poetry`, `conda`, or `pipenv`.

### Pip

VueGen is available on [PyPI][vuegen-pypi] and can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install vuegen
```

You can also install the package for development by cloning this repository and running the following command:

```bash
pip install -e path/to/vuegen # specify location
pip install -e . # in case your pwd is in the vuegen directory
```

### Conda

VueGen is also available on [Bioconda][vuegen-conda] and can be installed using conda:

```bash
conda install bioconda::vuegen
```

### Dependencies

VueGen uses [Quarto][quarto] to generate various report types. The pip insallation includes quarto using the [quarto-cli Python library][quarto-cli-pypi]. To test if quarto is installed in your computer, run the following command:

```bash
quarto check
```

> [!TIP]
> If quarto is not installed, you can download the command-line interface from the [Quarto website][quarto-cli] for your operating system.

### Docker

If you prefer not to install VueGen on your system, a pre-configured Docker container is available. It includes all dependencies, ensuring a fully reproducible execution environment. See the [Execution section](#execution) for details on running VueGen with Docker. The official Docker image is available at [quay.io/dtu_biosustain_dsp/vuegen][vuegen-docker-quay].

### Nextflow and nf-core

VueGen is also available as a [nf-core][nfcore] module, customised for compatibility with the [Nextflow][nextflow] environment. This module is designed to automate report generation from outputs produced by other modules, subworkflows, or pipelines. The code and documentation for the nf-core module are available in the [nf-VueGen repository][nf-vuegen].

## Execution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Here we use the `Earth_microbiome_vuegen_demo_notebook` directory and the `Earth_microbiome_vuegen_demo_notebook.yaml` configuration file as examples, which are available in the `docs/example_data` and `docs/example_config_files` folders, respectively. Make sure to clone this reposiotry to access these contents, or use your own directory and configuration file.

Run VueGen using a directory with the following command:

```bash
vuegen --directory docs/example_data/Earth_microbiome_vuegen_demo_notebook --report_type streamlit
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the `streamlit_autorun` argument is set to False, but you can use it in case you want to automatically run the streamlit app.

It's also possible to provide a configuration file instead of a directory:

```bash
vuegen --config docs/example_config_files/Earth_microbiome_vuegen_demo_notebook.yaml --report_type streamlit
```

The current report types supported by VueGen are:

- Streamlit
- HTML
- PDF
- DOCX
- ODT
- Reveal.js
- PPTX
- Jupyter

### Running VueGen with Docker

Instead of installing VueGen locally, you can run it directly from a Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/docs/example_data/Earth_microbiome_vuegen_demo_notebook:/home/appuser/Earth_microbiome_vuegen_demo_notebook" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output_docker:/home/appuser/streamlit_report" \
  quay.io/dtu_biosustain_dsp/vuegen:v0.3.1-docker --directory /home/appuser/Earth_microbiome_vuegen_demo_notebook --report_type streamlit
```

## GUI

### Local GUI

We have a simple GUI for VueGen that can be run locally or through a standalone executable.
For now you will need to have a copy of this repository.

```bash
pip install '.[gui]'
cd gui
python app.py
```

### Bundled GUI

The **bundle GUI** with the VueGen package is available under the
[latest releases](https://github.com/Multiomics-Analytics-Group/vuegen/releases/latest).
You will need to unzip the file and run `vuegen_gui` in the unpacked main folder.
Most dependencies are included into the bundle using PyInstaller.

Streamlit works out of the box as a purely Python based package. For `html` creation you will have to
have a Python 3.12 installation with the `jupyter` package installed as `quarto` needs to start
a kernel for execution. This is also true if you install `quarto` globally on your machine.

We recommend using miniforge to install Python and the conda package manager:

- [conda-forge.org/download/](https://conda-forge.org/download/)

We continous our example assuming you have installed the `miniforge` distribution for your
machine (MacOS with arm64/ apple silicon or x86_64/ intel or Windows x86_64). Also download
the [latest `vuegen_gui` bundle](https://github.com/Multiomics-Analytics-Group/vuegen/releases/latest)
from the releases page according to your operating system.

```bash
conda create -n vuegen_gui -c conda-forge python=3.12 jupyter
conda info -e # find environment location
```

Find the vuegen_gui path for your local `user`.

On **MacOS** you need to add a `bin` to the path:

```bash
/Users/user/miniforge3/envs/vuegen_gui/bin
```

On **Windows** you can use the path as displayed by `conda info -e`:

> Note: On Windows a base installation of miniforge with `jupyter` might work as well as
> the app can see your entire Path which is not the case on MacOS.

```bash
C:\Users\user\miniforge3\envs\vuegen_gui
```

More information regarding the app and builds can be found in the
[GUI README](https://github.com/Multiomics-Analytics-Group/vuegen/blob/main/gui/README.md).

## Case studies

VueGen’s functionality is demonstrated through two case studies:

**1. Predefined Directory**

This introductory case study uses a predefined directory with plots, dataframes, Markdown, and HTML components. Users can generate reports in different formats and modify the configuration file to customize the report structure.

🔗 [![Open in Colab][colab_badge]][colab_link_intro_demo]

**2. Earth Microbiome Project Data**

This advanced case study demonstrates the application of VueGen in a real-world scenario using data from the [Earth Microbiome Project (EMP)][emp]. The EMP is an initiative to characterize global microbial taxonomic and functional diversity. The notebook process the EMP data, create plots, dataframes, and other components, and organize outputs within a directory to produce reports. Report content and structure can be adapted by modifying the configuration file. Each report consists of sections on exploratory data analysis, metagenomics, and network analysis.

🔗 [![Open in Colab][colab_badge]][colab_link_emp_demo]

> [!NOTE]
> The EMP case study is available online as [HTML][emp-html-demo] and [Streamlit][emp-st-demo] reports.

## Web application deployment

Once a Streamlit report is generated, it can be deployed as a web application to make it accessible online. There are multiple ways to achieve this:

- **Streamlit Community Cloud**: Deploy your report easily using [Streamlit Cloud][st-cloud], as demonstrated in the [EMP VueGen Demo][emp-st-demo]. The process involves moving the necessary scripts, data, and a requirements.txt file into a GitHub repository. Then, the app can be deployed via the Streamlit Cloud interface. The deployment example is available in the `streamlit-report-example` branch.
- **Standalone Executables**: Convert your Streamlit application into a desktop app by packaging it as an executable file for different operating systems. A detailed explanation of this process can be found in this [Streamlit forum post][st-forum-exe].
- **Stlite**: Run Streamlit apps directly in the browser with [stlite][stlite], a WebAssembly port of Streamlit powered by Pyodide, eliminating the need for a server. It also allows packaging apps as standalone desktop executables using stlite desktop.

These options provide flexibility depending on whether the goal is online accessibility, lightweight execution, or local application distribution.
